    "\n",
    "Dimensional\n",
    "modeling is a preferred technique for\n",
    "presenting analytic data because it addresses two\n",
    "simultaneous requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "###  A. Why do People Confuse Dimensional Modeling with 3NF Relational Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dimensional models are quite\n",
    "different from third normal form (3NF) models which seek to\n",
    "remove data redundancies. Normalized 3NF structures\n",
    "divide data into many discrete entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, The industry sometimes refers to 3NF models as\n",
    "(ER) models, which are drawings that communicate the\n",
    "relationships between tables. Both 3NF and dimensional\n",
    "models can be represented in ERDs because both consist of\n",
    "joined relational tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key difference between 3NF and\n",
    "dimensional models is the degree of normalization. Because\n",
    "both model types can be presented as ERDs, we refrain\n",
    "from referring to 3NF models as ER models; instead, we call\n",
    "them normalized models to minimize confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalized 3NF structures are immensely useful in\n",
    "operational processing because an update or insert\n",
    "transaction touches the database in only one place.\n",
    "Normalized models, however, are too complicated for BI\n",
    "queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A dimensional model contains the same\n",
    "information as a normalized model, but packages\n",
    "the data in a format that delivers user\n",
    "understandability, query performance, and\n",
    "resilience to change**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Fact Table\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fact table in a dimensional model stores the\n",
    "performance measurements resulting from an organization's\n",
    "business process events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each row in a fact table corresponds to a measurement\n",
    "event. The data on each row is at a specific level of detail,\n",
    "referred to as the grain, such as one row per product sold on\n",
    "a sales transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea that a measurement event in the physical\n",
    "world has a one-to-one relationship to a single row\n",
    "in the corresponding fact table is a bedrock\n",
    "principle for dimensional modeling. Everything else\n",
    "builds from this foundation.\n"
